# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Tasks

### 0. Abstract Animal Class and its Subclasses
Create an abstract class named Animal using the ABC package. This class should have an abstract method called sound.
Create two subclasses of Animal: Dog and Cat. Implement the sound method in each subclass to return the strings “Bark” and “Meow” respectively.
### 1. Shapes, Interfaces, and Duck Typing
Create an abstract class named Shape with two abstract methods: area and perimeter.
Implement two concrete classes: Circle and Rectangle, both inheriting from Shape. Each class should provide implementations for the area and perimeter methods.
Write a standalone function named shape_info that accepts an object of type Shape (by duck typing) and prints its area and perimeter.
Test the shape_info function with instances of both Circle and Rectangle.
### 2. Extending the Python List with Notifications
Create a class named VerboseList that extends the Python list class. This custom class should print a notification message every time an item is added (using the append or extend methods) or removed (using the remove or pop methods).
### 3. CountedIterator - Keeping Track of Iteration
Create a class named CountedIterator that extends the built-in iterator obtained from the iter function. The CountedIterator should keep track of the number of items that have been iterated over. Specifically, you will need to override the __next__ method to increment a counter each time an item is fetched.
### 4. The Enigmatic FlyingFish - Exploring Multiple Inheritance
Construct a FlyingFish class that inherits from both a Fish class and a Bird class. Within FlyingFish, override methods from both parents. The goal is to comprehend multiple inheritance and how Python determines method resolution order.
### 5. The Mystical Dragon - Mastering Mixins
Design two mixin classes, SwimMixin and FlyMixin, each equipped with methods swim and fly respectively. Next, construct a class Dragon that inherits from both these mixins. Your aim is to show that a Dragon instance can both swim and fly.
