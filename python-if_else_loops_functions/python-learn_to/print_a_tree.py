#print a tree
# How tall is the tree: 5
# Use a whule loop and 3 for loops
# 4 spaces : 1 hash
# 3 spaces : 3 hashes
# 2 spaces : 5 hashes
# 1 spaces : 7 hashes
# 0 spaces : 9 hashes

# What i need to do?

# Decrement spaces by 1 each time through the loop
# Increment the hashes by 2 each time through the loop
# Save spaces to the stump by calculating tree height -1 
# Decrement from tree height until it equals 0 
# Print spaces and then hashes for each row
# Prtin stump paces and then 1 hash
