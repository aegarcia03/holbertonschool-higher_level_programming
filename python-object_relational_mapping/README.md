# Python - Object-relational mapping

## Tasks
- Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa
- Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
- Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.
- Write a script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!
